1. Binary file operations 
-The advantage of binary data is that it avoids the overhead and loss of precision used to convert numeric values to strings in I / O.
However, binary data is not a text file and only uses data that the program can read.
- write charcter to file in binary (std::ios::out | std::ios::binary)
- read charcter to ifle in binary (std::ios::in | std::ios::binary)
- in my code -std::ifstream ifs(file, std::ifstream::binary);

2.Binding a function to its arguments 
we need to use std::bind

3. Multi-threading 
-multi threading means In a process, multiple threads are processed simultaneously and You can implement multithreading through the thread class.
-in my code , 
thread* t = new thread[THREAD_SIZE];
		for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_SIZE; i++)
			t[i] = thread(converter, text, key, nbytes, Cryptor());

		for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_SIZE; i++)
			t[i].join();

-The join () function tells the main function to wait until the thread terminates.


Refelction

1. A multi-threaded solution improves the elapsed time to complete executionby distributing independent tasks across separate hardware threads
2. tasks . communications
3.A task refers to a group of instructions that represents an algorithm
4.The latency of a communication between a processor and a resource is at least oneorder of magnitude greater than that between the processor and main memory.  
5. The latency is called that the time to coplete a communication.
6.A
7. Role of problem size 
- The amount of time and space that a program requiresto execute increases with problem size
8.wha is the process?
-A process is an instance of a program executing on the host platform.
9.what is the thread?
- A thread is a sequence of a program instruction that the schedule can execute indefently
10.what is the vectorlization?
-Vectorization is the register-based technique that implements a singleinstruction multiple data scenario.  Vectorization takes advantage of any vector registers available within a CPU
