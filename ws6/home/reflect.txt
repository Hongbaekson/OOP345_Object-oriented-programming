1. The reason for using the vector container rather than any other available in the STL

Vector - Class template providing dynamic array container  and it is Similar to the array in the data structure. The index value can be accessed randomly (access at once).

in addtion, A vector is an array that can be flexibly stretched by automatically reallocating memory to match the number of elements

2.Why there is no need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your own code

Vector automatically deallocates unused memory


3.How the range-based for simplifies coding in this case
C ++ 11 introduces a new type of loop called a ranged-based for statement that provides a simpler and safer way to iterate over all elements, including arrays.
The loop loops through each array element and assigns the value of the current array element to the variable declared in element_declaration. For best results, element_declaration must be of the same type as the array element. Otherwise a type conversion occurs.
