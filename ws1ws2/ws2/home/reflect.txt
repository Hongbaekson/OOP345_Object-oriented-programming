1. the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations
	I don't need deep copy for move operations because original data doesn't need to be existed.
2. the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves
	Dynamic allocation allow the size is assigned on run time.
3. the changes you made in upgrading your w2 and Text modules
	By move assignment, I got faster result for move ones.

5 Rewrite the following code as a template to accept any data type


    template <typename T>
  void swap(T &a, T &b){

      T c;

      c = a;

      a = b;

      b = c;

  }

6. Rewrite the following code to provide a default data type of "int" and to allow the template to control the allocation size of the private array.

    Template  <typename T>
    class Array{
    T a[10];

   };
