The reason for specializing the sum() member function.
	- The reason is that std::string type have a different way of sum unlike other number types.
	  For example in my code, the number has the way of sum like "LVPair<L, V>::m_value + sum",
but string has the way of "std::string result = value + " " + LVPair<std::string, std::string>::m_value;"

The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.
	- The number and string have different type's initial value.
	  In my code, I initialize 0 for int and " " for std::string.
	  
The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.
	- That is because class variables can be shared by all instance so it should not belong to an instance.
	  In my code, I set the static value for width data outside of main function where the instances is used.
